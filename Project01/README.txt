
To compile project, open Solution in Visual Studio, then Start with or without debugging. 
If solution is not available, open .cpp file "project1sample.cpp" in Visual Studio and
debug that code to create a solution for usage. Make sure glut.h and other glut files are
in the same directory as the cpp file. If using another compiler, follow the protocol for that
compiler's directions.
